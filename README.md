# Attracive Interactions


Molecules and people interact with attractive or repulsive forces, switching behaviour between being drawn together to form groups and needing their space. This generative visuals piece consists of particles that randomly change their mind about feeling social or antisocial.<br>

Selected as one of the top projects of ProgramaLaPlaza Festival 2019, it was projected on the facade of Medialab-Prado in Madrid during Fall-Winter 2019.<br>

Particles are being generated out of an explosion-like event, and float around the 14.5 x 9.4-meter screen. 

The duration of the projection was around 30 seconds each time. 

Every repetition produces different results and can go on indefinitely.
